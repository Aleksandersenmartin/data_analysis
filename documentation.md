# Docutmentation of executed data analysis

Proper documentation is crucial in data analysis  to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and clairity for both you and other reviewing your work. Here's a structured approach to doccementing you data analysis process effectively: 


## 1. Start with a clear objective: 

Clearly state the purpose of the analysis, the questions you aim to answer, or the problem you're solving

````python
 - Include: 
		○ Objective: why is this analysis being conducted? 
		○ Context: Background information about the dataset or problem 
		○ Scope: What is included and excluded in this analysis:
````

Example: 

Objective: Analyze customer purchase behavior to identify patterns and predict future purchases.
Context: The dataset contains transaction records from January 2023 to June 2023 for an online retailer.
Scope: Focus on active customers (at least one purchase in the last 6 months). Exclude transactions with missing product details.


## 2. Document the Dataset 
Provide a detailed description of the dataset you ar using: 
	- Source: Where the data came from. 
	- Data Description: 
		○ Number of rows and columns 
		○ Description of each variable/column (data dictionary) 
		○ Data types and format 
	- Data Issues: 
		○ Mention any initial issues (e.g., missing values, duplicates, inconsistiencies) 
Example: 
````python
Dataset: Online Retail Sales Data
Source: Company Database
Columns:
- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer (int).
- OrderDate: Date of the transaction (datetime).
- Product: Name of the purchased product (string).
- SalesAmount: Revenue generated from the transaction (float).
Issues:
- Missing CustomerID for 2% of transactions.
- Outliers detected in SalesAmount (values above $10,000).
````

## 3. Document the preprocessing steps

- Log all data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing actions
- For each step, explain: 
	○ What did you do (e.g., removed duplicates, handeled missing values) 
	○ Why you did it (e.g., to ensure data quelity, remove bias) 
	○ How you did it (e.g., imputation method, formula) 
Example: 
```python
Preprocessing Steps:
1. Removed 1,200 duplicate rows to ensure unique transactions.
2. Handled missing values:
   - Imputed missing CustomerID values using the mode.
   - Dropped rows with missing SalesAmount (less than 1% of data).
3. Converted OrderDate column to datetime format for consistency.
4. Standardized column names to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores.
````

## 4. Log Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

- Record insight gained from EDA 
- Include: 
	○ Summary statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation 
	○ Visualization: Histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps.
	○ Key patterns: Trends, correlations, distributions. 

Examples: 
````python
EDA Findings:
1. Average SalesAmount: $245. Median: $200. Standard Deviation: $50.
2. Strong positive correlation (0.85) between Product Quantity and SalesAmount.
3. Most sales occur in December, indicating a seasonal pattern.
Visualization:
- Attached bar chart showing monthly sales trends.
````

## 5. Describe the Analysis Approach
- Specify the type of analysis (descriptive, predictive, prescriptive, etc.) 
- Document: 
		○ Algorithms/models used (if applicable) 
		○ Assumtions made (e.g., normal distribution, independence of varibales) 
		○ Validation methods (e.g., cross-validation, test/train split) 

Example: 
````python
Analysis Approach:
1. Predictive Modeling:
   - Logistic regression to predict customer churn.
   - Assumption: Customers with less than 3 transactions in the last 6 months are likely to churn.
2. Validation:
   - Used 80/20 train-test split.
   - Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
````
	
## 6. Log Challenges and Limitations: 
Be transparent about the limitations of the anlaysis and any challenges faced: 
	- Challenges: problems encountered during data cleaning, analysis, or modeling 
	- Limitations: Factors that may affect the generalizebility or accuracy of the results: 

Examples: 
````python
Challenges:
- Dataset contained inconsistent formatting in the Product column, which required manual standardization.
- High class imbalance (90% active, 10% churned customers).

Limitations:
- Analysis is based on historical data and may not account for recent market changes.
- Assumption of normal distribution may not hold for SalesAmount.
````

## 7. Document Results and insights 
- Record all findings, supported by vixualisations and statistical measures. 
- Highlight actionable insights or recommendation based on the results. 

Examples: 
````python
Results:
1. Top 10% of customers contribute 60% of total revenue.
2. Predictive model achieved 85% accuracy in identifying churned customers.
3. Seasonal sales peak in December suggests opportunity for targeted marketing.

Recommendations:
1. Focus retention efforts on high-value customers to minimize churn.
2. Increase marketing campaigns in Q4 to capitalize on seasonal trends.
````

## 8. Save code and outputs 
- Include: 
		○ Scripts/notebooks with clarly commented code 
		○ Data preprocessing steps 
		○ Visualization and model outputs 
Example:
````python
# Removing duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Handling missing values
df['CustomerID'] = df['CustomerID'].fillna(df['CustomerID'].mode()[0])

# Visualization: Monthly Sales Trends
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df['OrderDate'].groupby(df['OrderDate'].dt.month).sum().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title("Monthly Sales Trends")
plt.show()
````


## 9. Include a summary 
Summarize the entire process in a concise format: 
	- Objective 
	- Key findings 
	- Recommendations 
	- Next step

Examples: 
````python
Summary:
Objective: Identify patterns in customer purchase behavior and predict churn.
Findings:
- 60% of revenue comes from top 10% customers.
- December is the peak sales month.
Recommendations:
1. Implement loyalty programs for high-value customers.
2. Increase marketing efforts in Q4.
Next Steps:
- Refine churn prediction model using additional customer behavior data.
- Test targeted marketing strategies based on insights.
